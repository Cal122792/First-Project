    <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Well, I’m 31, which is just old enough to know better but young enough to still make questionable life decisions for the story. I’m from Australia — yes, the land of kangaroos, Vegemite, and suspiciously large spiders that somehow always seem to appear right above your bed. I’ve always had a soft spot for the great outdoors, whether it’s climbing up actual mountains or just convincing my friends to hike somewhere with a “bit of a view” (which they later describe as “a several-hour vertical death march”). For me, there’s something about being up high — maybe it’s the view, maybe it’s the oxygen deprivation — but it makes life feel a little clearer.</p>

<p>Lately, I’ve thrown myself into the mysterious and occasionally infuriating world of coding. It’s a lot like climbing, really — you try something, you fail, you hang there wondering what went wrong, and then you try again until you somehow get to the top (or your laptop goes out the window). At the moment, I’m wandering around Europe, which means my days are a mix of cobblestone streets, historical landmarks, and awkwardly trying to order food in languages I barely speak. I’ve been making a habit of getting lost on purpose — because honestly, that’s when you find the best little cafés, views, and stories.</p>

<p>I’m not sure where this adventure is heading — both the trip and life in general — but I’m okay with that. Whether it’s chasing a sunset, a tricky bit of code, or a mountain peak, I guess I’m just here for the climb.</p>
